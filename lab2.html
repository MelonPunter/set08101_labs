			<p> The UK economy will shrink and perform worse than other advanced economies, including Russia, as the cost of living continues to hit households,

				rising mortgage costs and increased taxes, as well as persistent worker shortages.It did not mention Brexit in its report as a factor
				for the UK not performing as well as others. Today marks three years since the UK left the EU. </p>
			
			<h4> Heading 4 </h4>
			
			<p> The UK is expected be the only country to shrink next year across all the advanced and emerging economies.
				Even sanctions-hit Russia is now forecast to grow this year. </p>
